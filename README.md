## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

# I want to create a project that I can use to educate others on the pressing issues of climate change, and more specifically deforestation. I want to do this through the avenue of a visual novel written in python, which I think can be a great way to educate users through user interaction and I think it will be a good way to make the information I want to convey visual. I also want to use data analysis ideas and implement them into my project. I want to use plots and visual representations of data on deforestation within the visual novel to help educate the user while going through the visual novel. I will use open source data that I can find online to educate the user and create this plots and graphs depicting figures on deforestation. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

# I will be working on my own.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

# I do not have any other questions of my own.
